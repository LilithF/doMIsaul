\title{Remove small clusters (ie unclassified observations for which no consensus
was obtained)}
\usage{
cleanUp_partition(
  partition,
  min.cluster.size = 10,
  level.order = NULL,
  Unclassified = c(NA, "Unclassified")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{partition}{the partition to clean (vector).}

\item{min.cluster.size}{Minimum cluster size (ie, smaller clusters will be
discarded)}

\item{level.order}{optional. If you supply a variable the  cluster levels will
be ordinated according to the mean values for the variable}

\item{Unclassified}{string for the label of the unclassified observations.
defaults value is \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
The cleaned up partition (factor).
}
\description{
Remove small clusters (ie unclassified observations for which no consensus
was obtained)
