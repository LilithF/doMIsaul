Description: Algorithms for (i) unsupervised learning for dataset with
    missing data and/or left-censored data, using multiple imputation and
    consensus clustering ; (ii) semisupervised learning with a survival
    endpoint (right-censored) for complete or incomplete datasets, using
    multiple imputation and consensus clustering in the latter case.
