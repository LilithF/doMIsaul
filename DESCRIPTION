    c(person(given = "Lilith", family = "Faucheux", role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "lilith.faucheux@inserm.fr"),
      person(given = "Sylvie", family = "Chevret", role = c("ths")),

Description: Algorithms for (i) unsupervised learning for dataset with
    missing data and/or left-censored data, using multiple imputation and
    consensus clustering ; (ii) semisupervised learning with a survival
    endpoint (right-censored) for complete or incomplete datasets, using
    multiple imputation and consensus clustering in the latter case.
