The goal of \code{doMIsaul} is to provide function to perform unsupervised and 
semisupervised learning for an incomplete dataset.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of doMIsaul from -->
<!-- [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("doMIsaul") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LilithF/doMIsaul")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to perform unsupervised learning 
for an incomplete dataset:

```{r example_unsup}
library(doMIsaul)
## basic example code
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to perform semisupervised learning 
for an incomplete dataset with a survival outcome:


```{r example_semisup}
data(cancer, package = "survival")

```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->


<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
