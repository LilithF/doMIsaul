Description: Algorithms for (i) unsupervised learning for
    dataset with missing data and/or left-censored data, using multiple
    imputation and consensus clustering ; (ii) semisupervised learing with
    a survival endpoint (right-censored) for complete or incomplete
    datasets, using multiple imputation and consensus clustering in the
    latter case.
